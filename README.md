# Setup

U's Game uses `pnpm`. After `pnpm install`, set up a `.env` file with two variables: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (populated with a [service role Supabase key](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uclorczowqqvmumvftsc/settings/api)) and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://uclorczowqqvmumvftsc.supabase.co`.

# Deployment

U's Game is deployed on Vercel, which requires the same environment variables.

# TODOs

- Winning screen
- Have player be a column in the moves table
